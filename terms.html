          <p class="legal-text">
            <strong>THIS APPLICATION IS FOR EDUCATIONAL AND INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.</strong> The wood identification 
            results provided by this Application should not be used as the sole basis for purchasing decisions or 
            structural applications.
          </p>
          <p class="legal-text">
            Identification accuracy depends on multiple factors including image quality, lighting conditions, wood visibility, 
            and angle of the photograph. While we provide a confidence score with each identification, no AI-based identification 
            can be 100% certain.

            <strong>Important considerations:</strong>

            <li><strong>Verify with professionals</strong> before making significant purchasing or construction decisions based on identification results.</li>
            <li><strong>Wood properties may vary</strong> within the same species due to growing conditions, age, and treatment.</li>
            <li><strong>Consult experts</strong> for structural applications or valuable antique furniture authentication.</li>

            The Service Provider accepts no liability for any financial loss or damages resulting from actions taken based on 
            the identification results provided by this Application.

          <p class="legal-text">
            The Service Provider is dedicated to ensuring that the Application is as beneficial and efficient as possible. As such, they reserve 
            the right to modify the Application or charge for their services at any time and for any reason. The Service Provider assures you

          <h2 class="legal-heading">Data Storage and Device Security</h2>
          <p class="legal-text">
            The Application stores and processes personal data that you have provided to the Service Provider in order to provide the Service. 
            It is your responsibility to maintain the security of your phone and access to the Application. The Service Provider strongly 
            advise against jailbreaking or rooting your phone, which involves removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the 
            official operating system of your device. Such actions could expose your phone to malware, viruses, malicious programs, compromise 
            your phone's security features, and may result in the Application not functioning correctly or at all.

            Please note that the Application utilizes third-party services that have their own Terms and Conditions. Below are the links to the 
            Terms and Conditions of the third-party service providers used by the Application:

        <section class="legal-section">
          <h2 class="legal-heading">Internet Connection and Data Usage</h2>
          <p class="legal-text">
            Please be aware that the Service Provider does not assume responsibility for certain aspects. Some functions of the Application 
            require an active internet connection, which can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider. The Service Provider cannot 
            be held responsible if the Application does not function at full capacity due to lack of access to Wi-Fi or if you have exhausted 
            your data allowance.
          </p>
          <p class="legal-text">
            If you are using the application outside of a Wi-Fi area, please be aware that your mobile network provider's agreement terms still 
            apply. Consequently, you may incur charges from your mobile provider for data usage during the connection to the application, or 
            other third-party charges. By using the application, you accept responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges 
            if you use the application outside of your home territory (i.e., region or country) without disabling data roaming. If you are not 
            the bill payer for the device on which you are using the application, they assume that you have obtained permission from the bill payer.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="legal-section">
          <h2 class="legal-heading">Device Responsibility</h2>
          <p class="legal-text">
            Similarly, the Service Provider cannot always assume responsibility for your usage of the application. For instance, it is your 
            responsibility to ensure that your device remains charged. If your device runs out of battery and you are unable to access the Service, 
            the Service Provider cannot be held responsible.

        <section class="legal-section">
          <h2 class="legal-heading">Service Provider's Liability</h2>
          <p class="legal-text">
            In terms of the Service Provider's responsibility for your use of the application, it is important to note that while they strive to 
            ensure that it is updated and accurate at all times, they do rely on third parties to provide information to them so that they can 
            make it available to you. The Service Provider accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, that you experience as a result 
            of relying entirely on this functionality of the application.
          </p>

        <section class="legal-section">
          <h2 class="legal-heading">Application Updates and Termination</h2>
          <p class="legal-text">
            The Service Provider may wish to update the application at some point. The application is currently available as per the requirements 
            for the operating system (and for any additional systems they decide to extend the availability of the application to) may change, 
            and you will need to download the updates if you want to continue using the application. The Service Provider does not guarantee that 
            it will always update the application so that it is relevant to you and/or compatible with the particular operating system version 
            installed on your device. However, you agree to always accept updates to the application when offered to you. The Service Provider may 
            also wish to cease providing the application and may terminate its use at any time without providing termination notice to you. Unless 
            they inform you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must cease 
            using the application, and (if necessary) delete it from your device.
